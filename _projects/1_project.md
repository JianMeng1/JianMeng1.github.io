<h1> The bigger picture </h1>
<p>Do people process moral issues differently in their native and non-native languages? So far, many studies (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2020.1730763"> Driver, 2022 </a>; <a href= "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094842"> Costa et al., 2014 </a>) have suggested bilinguals process morality differently in their L1 versus L2, which might be accounted by the foreign langauge distance effects.  In addition, some studies (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/bilinguals-on-the-footbridge-the-role-of-foreignlanguage-proficiency-in-moral-decision-making/C7A25FAC773BB8C2B5EA127CAA250DAB">Dorfman et al., 2024</a>) found that L2 proficiency level is related to the moral processing. This is probably because processing moral information in a less proficient langauge consumes more cognitive resources, leaving less room for moral processing. </p>

<h1> Monolingual English speakers' moral processing </h1>
<p>This EEG study aims to see the ERP components of moral violation processing, and how it is different from semantic processing. 37 native English-speaking young adults (17 f, 10m, 1 non-binary) were recruited in Gainesville, Florida. They silently read the sentential stimuli while their EEG was recorded. </p>

<p> Experimental stimuli were in English and consisted of three conditions: moral violation, semantic
violation, and a neutral condition (see Table 1).Each trial started with a context sentence, different for each condition, presented in its entirely. This was followed by a target sentence containing words that
were neutral or induced a moral or semantic violation given the context. The target sentence
was the same for each condition and was presented word by word. </p>

<p> Mean ERP amplitude was obtained from three time windows at the critical word region: early
potentials from 150ms to 250ms (frontocentral electrodes), N400 from 300ms to 500ms (central
electrodes), and late potentials from 500ms to 800ms (central-parietal electrodes).  In the 500-800ms window, the two violation conditions showed a significantly larger LPC amplitude than the neutral condition. The moral condition had a more positive amplitude than the semantic condition. The latter effect already started in the 300-500 ms N400 window (see Figure 1). </p>
