<p>Do people process moral issues differently in their native and non-native languages? So far, many studies (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13670050.2020.1730763"> Driver, 2022 </a>; <a href= "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094842" Costa et al., 2014 </a>) have suggested bilinguals process morality differently in their L1 versus L2, which might be accounted by the foreign langauge distance effects.  In addition, some studies (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/bilinguals-on-the-footbridge-the-role-of-foreignlanguage-proficiency-in-moral-decision-making/C7A25FAC773BB8C2B5EA127CAA250DAB"> Dorfman et al., 2024 </a>)found that L2 proficiency level is related to the moral processing. This is probably because processing moral information in a less proficient langauge consumes more cognitive resources, leaving less room for moral processing. </p>

<p>Our EEG study aims to see the ERP components of moral violation processing, and how it is different from semantic processing. At this stage, the data collection is still ongoing. In the image below, we show a preliminary analysis on the grand average of 7 participants' Fz electrode ERP components. There is not much significant difference we could see between the semantic violation processing and the moral violation processing so far. With more data trickling in, we hope to see a larger difference between these two conditions.</p>

<p>There are two possible directions we want to investigate: first, we would like to see how the moral violation processing is related to the individuals' moral judgement. Moral judgement can be very personal. Different people can have very different moral judgements on the same event. We hope to find something interesting by conducting an item-based analysis. Second, we are interested in looking at participantsâ€™ adaptation on the moral violations. We speculate that we might see a gradual decrease of the ERP component amplitude throughout the trials since the participants become less stimulated by the moral violations. </p>

Any thoughts? Pleaee reach out to me if you are intrugued by our study!
