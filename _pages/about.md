I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), where I collaborate with [Dr. Edith Kaan](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/kaan/) at the Brain Language and Bilingualism [(BLAB)](https://blab.lin.ufl.edu/) lab.

Before joining UF linguistics, I earned my master’s degree in ISHD (Interdisciplinary Studies of Human Development) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), and a bachelor’s degree in English at Zhejiang International Studies University. My research focuses on utilizing EEG, behavioral experiments and computational methods to investigate syntactic processing. Currently, I am leading an ERP project exploring the brain's response to moral violations. To learn more about my studies, feel free to explore my research project page.
